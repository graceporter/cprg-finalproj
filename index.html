            <h3>Griffith Woods</h3>
            <p>Griffith Woods is a park in the south west of Calgary. There is a perfect 5km loop here, which consists of dirt and paved trails. 45 Discovery Ridge Link S.W.</p>

            <h3>Glenmore Reservoir</h3>
            <p>Glenmore Reservoir is very close to home, and has an awesome 14km loop with varying elevations, all on a paved path. Lots to see, so it doesn't get boring! I start the run here: 1600 90 Ave SW, Calgary, AB</p>

            <h3>Pea Guy</h3>
            <p>I saw this guy on my longest run so far, and obviously had to ask for a picture! He said he does it for mental health!</p>

            <h3>New Shoes!</h3>
            <p>My very first pair of actual running shoes! These are the Asics Gel Nimbus 26. They feel like walking on a cloud.</p>

            <h3>Winter Sunsets</h3>
            <p>As much as I hate how early it gets dark, nothing beats a winter sunset. Especially in the woods, on a run.</p>

            <h3>Crampons!</h3>
            <p>I got crampons for Christmas so I was able to keep running throughout the winter! These worked awesome on the trails at Griffith Woods</p>

<h2>About My Training</h2>
<button class="accordion">How Often Am I Running?</button>
    <div class="panel">
    <p>So far, I've been trying to get in 2 shorter & faster runs to work on my pace time, and 1 long run a week. On top of that I have soccer once a week which is great for interval training.</p>
        </div>
 
<button class="accordion">My Lifting Split</button>
    <div class="panel">
        <p>Typically i lift to build muscle, but right now I'm just concerned about maintaing, as well as injury prevention. <span class="bold-text">My current split is:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Push: chest, shoulders, triceps</li>
        <li>Heavy legs: RDLs, KAS glute bridges, split squats, step ups, glute extensions, leg extensions. (Not all of these, I usually pick 3)</li>
        <li>Pull: back and biceps</li>
        <li>Light legs/stretching: This usually consists of light leg workouts to break up some of the lactic acid, and then a LOT of stretching & hip strengthening.</li>
    </ul>
        </div>
 
    <button class="accordion">Music</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p><span class="bold-text">These are my top 5 favourite songs to run to:</span></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Everlong - Foo Fighters</li>
            <li>Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away) - Deftones</li>
            <li>wonder if you care - flyingfish</li>
            <li>scars - Novulent</li>
